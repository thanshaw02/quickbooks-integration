# Summary

A small reposityory for testing out integrating QuickBooks into a project using Typescript. This includes custom Typescript types for the `intuit-oauth` library and will possibly include custom Typescript types for the `node-quickbooks` library (however the QuickBooks library is very large so this may be time consuming).

# Custom Typescript Types

You can find my custom `intuit-oauth` types at the root level directory under `intuit-oauth.d.ts`

You can find my custom `node-quickbooks` types at the root level directory under `node-quickbooks.d.ts`
